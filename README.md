# Cypress Automation Framework

## 1. Why I Chose This Tech Stack and Design Pattern

I chose **Cypress** with the **Page Object Model (POM)** and Javascript because Cypress provides **seamless integration for email testing**, is **fast, reliable**, supports **automatic retries**, and has **dynamic timeouts** to handle flaky tests effectively.

The **Page Object Model (POM)** ensures **code reusability, maintainability**, and a well-structured framework that enhances scalability and efficiency. This approach allows for a **robust and efficient test automation suite**.

## 2. Running in Multiple Environments

To ensure this framework runs smoothly across multiple environments, I have made it **fully dynamic**.

- All environment-specific configurations, including **credentials, database details, URLs, tokens, and domains**, are stored in the `.env` file.
- This eliminates any environment dependenciesâ€”simply updating the `.env` file allows the framework to be executed on any environment without modifications.
- By following **best practices**, the framework is **scalable, flexible, and easy to maintain**.

## 3. Test Classification and Execution in Separate Suites

To efficiently organize and execute test cases across different suites:

- I have used **Cypress grep tags** (`@smoke`, `@regression`, etc.), allowing tests to be classified into different groups.
- Test cases are stored in **separate test files**, ensuring **independent execution** without any test dependency.
- Example of running specific test suites:
  - **Smoke Tests** â†’ `npm run e2e:smoke:tests`
  - **Regression Tests** â†’ `npm run e2e:regression:tests`

This setup makes test execution **modular, efficient, and highly scalable**.

## 4. CI/CD Integration

For CI/CD integration, I plan to use **GitHub Actions or Jenkins** for automation.

- **Dockerized Cypress images** will ensure smooth and isolated test execution.
- **Cypress Dashboard** or **Github Actions** will enable **parallel test execution** across multiple machines.
- **Kubernetes Pods** will provide **scalability**, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
- **Test Reporting**:
  - **AIO Test Reporter / Mochawesome or any other reporting tool ** will be used to **log test results and generate reports**.
  - This will allow real-time monitoring of test execution in CI/CD pipelines.
- **Dynamic execution in CI/CD**:
  - The framework will run on **any environment** without manual intervention.
  - It will be integrated into **pre-release and post-release workflows**, allowing any sorts of tests like Smoke, Regression, Sanity to run automatically before or after deployment.
- **Shift-Left Testing**:
  - By implementing **early-stage automation**, bugs will be detected **sooner in the development cycle**, leading to **faster and higher-quality releases**.

## 5. Additional Notes on Implementation

- **API-Driven Approach**:
  - The framework leverages APIs for **setup, assertions, and validations**, making it **efficient and reliable**.
- **Selectors Optimization**:
  - Using **data-test-id selectors** ensures tests remain **stable and non-flaky**.
- **Best Practices & Code Quality**:
  - The framework follows **industry-standard best practices**, including:
    - **ESLint** for code formatting and consistency.
    - **Cypress plugins** such as:
      - `mochawesome` â†’ **For detailed HTML test reports**.
      - `cypress-plugin-api` â†’ **For API testing**.
      - `cypress-grep` â†’ **For filtering tests using tags**.
      - `mailosaur` â†’ **For email testing and validation**.
- **Challenges & Workarounds**:
  - Due to **restrictions in the production environment**, I couldn't log in via Cypress and run my test cases locally.
  - However, the framework is designed to work seamlessly across environments with minor adjustments.
